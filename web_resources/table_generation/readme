Code to make various interactive plots for the gh-pages branch

Make them here and then copy them into the straycats_web branch so that they show
up on the web page.

Note that the jupyter notebook versions are all out of date. Just use the make_tables.py script,
which also has the benefit of making the links for the NuSTARStrayCats github rather than bwgref
