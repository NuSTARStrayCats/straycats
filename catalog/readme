First, download the table from the Google Drive / Box into CSV files in the csv directory

Update the README there.

Second, grab the latest numaster.fits table and put it in the fits subdirectory

The *first* version was created by parse_and_merge.py which produces the straycats.fits file in the fits subdirectory

We then added more information to the full catalog.

Naming Conventions
------------------

straycats_vX_0.fits:
    Includes basic info that are based on parse_and_merge.py (initial run) and
    add_versionX.py for future runs. This serves as the basis for the runs that Renee
        does for producing the region files and the various products
    
    You'll want to make a new add_versionX.py script every time. Update the StrayID tag
        on line 189 to update for your version.
    
    Latest version here is v3.0 (Updated by Brian in ~Feb 2023 for Jan 2022-Dec 2022)
        for StrayCatsIII
    
straycats_incrX.fits:
    Incremental update *just* including the new rows. This is useful for passing short
        tables back and forth.
 
    After this is complete, send off the FITS files to Renee for further processing
 
straycats_vX_1.fits:
    After you get the information back from Renee, we'll incorporate the updated
        incremental update into the full catalog
        
        See add_renee_data_v2_1.py






Workflow
---------

- Add new rows (StrayCats_XX) where XX is the update number
    Current version: II from Renee's paper
    Covers through Jan 1, 2022
- Update any unknowns / faint rows
- Go make the region files (by hand?)
    Put these here: /disk/bifrost/rmludlam/straycats/SL_regions
- Reprocess observations (if necessary, ask Renee how this is set up)
- Produce source / background estimates for 3-8 and 8-13 keV bands
- Update straycats.fits table
- Make products:
    See:  /users/bwgref/bifrost/straycats_lcs
    ...this needs a README file
- Update web tables
- Update summary webpages
- Update source webpages
- Push to website
- Profit
