First, download the table from the Google Drive into CSV files in the csv directory

Second, grab the latest numaster.fits table and put it in the fits subdirectory

Then just run python parse_and_merge.py which produces the straycats.fits file in the fits subdirectory

Have to run add_version2.py to add in the stuff from the second catalog run

Then run add_renee_data.py to add in in the count rates. NA values are -999.0
