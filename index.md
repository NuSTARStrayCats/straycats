### The columns of the StrayCats FITS file are:

1. StrayID:

    The Catalog identifier, which is StrayCatsI_XX where XX is the row number after the catalog is sorted the RA and Dec for the focused NuSTAR sequence ID.

2. Classification

   The classifications are:
   1. 'SL': Identified stray light source
   2. 'Complex': Multiple overlapping SL sources are present, difficult to analyze)
   3. 'Faint': Potential faint stray light
   4. 'GR': Ghost-rays from a source just outside of the FoV
   5. 'Unkn': Stray light from an unidentified source

3. SEQID

    The NuSTAR sequence ID
    
4. Module

    The NuSTAR FPM that contains the stray light (A or B)
    
5. Exposure

    The exposure time for this observation in seconds
    
6. Multi (FITS only)

    Whether the sequence ID contains multiple stray light patterns (Yes/No) 

7. Primary

    Primary Target

8. Time

    MJD time of the observation
    
9. RA / DEC of the Primary

10. SL Source

    If identified, otherwise ??
    
11. SL Type

    If we have identified the type of the object, this will be here
    
12. SIMAD_ID

    ID for the source in SIMBAD
    
13. RA/Dec of SL source

    If known. Otherwise -999
